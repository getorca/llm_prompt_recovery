    "# Sentence Averaging (for similar meaning):\n",
    "\n",
    "This method creates a new sentence that captures the average meaning of the 100 sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Preprocess: Clean and normalize your sentences (lowercase, remove punctuation, etc.). You can use libraries like NLTK for this.\n",
    "2) Tokenization: Break each sentence into individual words (tokens).\n",
    "4) Word Averaging: For each word position (e.g., 1st word, 2nd word), calculate the average frequency of words across all sentences at that position. This might involve stemming/lemmatization (reducing words to their base form) for better averaging.\n",
    "5) New Sentence Generation: Based on the average frequencies, choose the most likely word for each position to create a new sentence. This sentence might not be grammatically perfect, but it should capture the central meaning of the 100 sentences."
